Cpp-Libraries
===================

C++ Libraries for Sorting, Searching, & Data Structures.

Why
-------

This is a set of C++ libraries used as a test bed to create new and interesting implementations for standard and non-standard data structures and sorting & searching algorithms. Many people have asked me why I created this since there is a wealth of highly tuned libraries already available in C++ through STL and Boost. My answer to that is simple: to learn. I feel it extremely neccessary for a Software Engineer to understand the underlying mechanics of the devices and constructs that he/she uses. Being able to 100% explain the space/time complexity trade-off of using a tail pointer for a linked list is important to me. And the best way to learn this in software is to implement it. So, that is what I am doing!

I am most interested in some of the more advanced tree structures and graph searching algorithms so those are probably going to get more attention than more basic DXs like lists.
